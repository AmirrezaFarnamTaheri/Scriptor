# Verification record

This document defines proof for the current source candidate. A release record must name the exact commit, source-tree hash, command, environment, target architecture, and artifact set.

## Claim vocabulary

- **Verified:** the stated command executed against this source state and passed.
- **Statically validated:** source or generated metadata was parsed and checked without compiling or running the full product.
- **Reviewed:** code and contracts were inspected without executable proof.
- **Pending:** required proof depends on unavailable tooling, dependencies, platform, browser, or canonical history.
- **Failed:** the stated command executed and did not pass.

## Repository-native checks

Run from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm check:source
pnpm check:governance
pnpm check:mcp
pnpm check:plugins
pnpm check:canvas
pnpm check:editor
pnpm check:portal
pnpm check:renderer
pnpm check:export
pnpm check:headless
pnpm check:citations
pnpm check:knowledge
pnpm check:merge
```

`check:source` covers generated IPC contracts, Rust source/module/process/unsafe policy, native authorization, frontend policy, hotspot ownership, benchmark utilities, release trust/evidence contracts, and the RustSec exception ledger. `check:governance` covers version parity, immutable Actions, package boundaries, locale parity, documentation/license contracts, frontend policy, and hotspot ownership.

## Full engineering gate

A release candidate is not verified until these commands pass in a clean environment with the pinned toolchains and frozen lockfiles:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.33.0 --activate
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm lint
pnpm check:contracts
pnpm build
pnpm check:release
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo deny check
pnpm audit --prod
```

`pnpm build` includes the production bundle graph and initial gzip budget check. Warning-zero ESLint is part of `pnpm lint`.

## UI and accessibility gate

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm test:visual
pnpm check:a11y
pnpm check:a11y-axe
```

Required manual matrix:

- 320, 375, 768, 1024, and 1440 CSS-pixel widths;
- light, dark, and high-contrast themes;
- Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop shells;
- keyboard-only primary workflows;
- screen-reader smoke test;
- 200% browser/OS text zoom;
- reduced-motion mode;
- empty, loading, error, success, destructive-confirmation, and long-content states.

Toolbar-popover verification must prove that Typography and Insert menus:

- are portaled outside `.editor-toolbar` and its horizontal overflow clipping;
- remain inside the visual viewport after resize and ancestor scrolling;
- reposition through bounded DOM style updates without a React render loop;
- focus the first menu item when opened from the keyboard;
- support Arrow Up/Down, Home, End, Escape, Tab, and outside-click dismissal;
- restore focus to the trigger after Escape dismissal.

Visual evidence captures must wait until the rendered preview has settled (the expected preview
heading is visible and no `.preview-error` is present). Baseline assertions are reserved for stable
core surfaces; transient/state-review screenshots are attached to the Visual review job instead of
creating missing-baseline failures. Documentation screenshots mirror reviewed Windows baselines
with the platform suffix removed; regenerate them with `scripts/screenshots/capture.ps1`.

## Release and recovery gate

- Build every installer from the exact audited tag.
- Assert that each runner architecture matches its declared target before packaging.
- Produce Windows x86_64, macOS aarch64, Linux x86_64, and Linux aarch64 target sets.
- Transport only installer files and one `signing-evidence-<platform>-<architecture>.json` record per target.
- Separate publication inputs into exactly seven installers under `release-artifacts` and exactly four trust records under `release-evidence`.
- Verify that official target records state `signed: false`, `notarized: false`, and `signatureType: "none"`.
- Run `node scripts/release/verify-signing-evidence.mjs release-evidence production` before generating the receipt.
- Generate `SHA256SUMS` over the seven installer subjects only and receipt schema 4 with the four normalized trust records embedded.
- Run `node scripts/release/verify-release-evidence.mjs release-artifacts release-evidence`; the verifier rejects source drift, a dirty checkout, missing or extra installer subjects, unsafe paths, symlinks, checksum/SBOM mismatch, incomplete target status, and target/source identity drift.
- Verify GitHub provenance and SBOM attestations for every installer plus immutable release-tag lineage.
- Confirm that release notes disclose unknown-publisher behavior and provide single-installer checksum and attestation commands.
- Clean-install each package and record operating-system warnings caused by the explicit unsigned policy.
- Create an external backup, corrupt a copy, prove rejection, and restore on each supported OS.
- Interrupt restore and MCP mutation flows and prove deterministic recovery.
- Run startup, idle-memory, index, search, graph, editor, and export performance gates.

## Release workflow invariants

- Manual dispatch defaults to preview and never publishes unless `publish: true` is supplied on an existing `v*` tag.
- A `VERSION` change on `main` creates an immutable tag only when the version is unused.
- An existing tag that points to another commit is a hard failure; it is never moved.
- The kickoff workflow uses `workflow_dispatch` because events emitted with `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not normally trigger another workflow.
- The unified `Release` workflow is the only GitHub Release owner; the former ARM-specific publication workflow is removed.
- Architecture-bearing filenames prevent collisions when artifacts are merged for publication.
- The release upload boundary excludes unpacked bundle internals and CI evidence.
- Checksums and attestations cover installers, while target trust records remain separately verified release metadata.

## Canonical history gate

Run from a full canonical clone:

```bash
bash scripts/governance/history-audit.sh . .history-audit
```

Also run an approved full-history secret scanner and capture branch protection, required reviews, environment protection, tag lineage, and release lineage from the hosting platform.

## Historical remediation evidence

The 2026-08-03 remediation candidate verified repository-native source, authorization, frontend, release-evidence, package-boundary, locale, documentation, RustSec, and benchmark contracts. Some native build, browser, signing, clean-install, recovery, and full-history checks remained environment-dependent.

The 0.1.1 release work supersedes the former mandatory-signing claim. It does not weaken source or artifact integrity checks: publisher signing is removed as a prerequisite, while exact target identity, checksum, SBOM, receipt, source binding, immutable tags, and GitHub attestations remain fail-closed.

A passing source-level contract is not by itself proof of a successful public release. The authoritative completion evidence is the exact-head CI matrix plus the production tag workflow and published release assets.
